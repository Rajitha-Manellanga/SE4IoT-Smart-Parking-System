# SE4IoT-Smart-Parking-System

The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a widely used phrase in our daily lives, with a wide range of applications. Smart Parking System is an example of IoT application. With the aid of IoT, the system allows real-time data to be obtained about parking availability, which assists drivers to find parking slots. The system offers solutions for urban mobility.
Although there are existing smart parking systems, still there are features to be improved. In order to implement smart features of the parking system, different types of sensors and IoT devices are applicable. The proposed IoT solution aims to improve currently available parking system features. When compared to a traditional parking system, smart parking systems have several advantages.


Files description:
* testcase.csv file is used in "parking environment" to simulate the sensors.
* node-red flows are included seperately for each task.
* car sample images are used to detect license plate numbers in "entry gate" and "exit gate".
* grafana dashboard is exported as a single json file.
* SmartParkingSystem.sql file is used as a simulation for the booking system in the "entry gate" and "exit gate".
* parking_slot.autogen.00016.00 is the backup file of influxdb database (influxdb 1.8).
